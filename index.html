        <p>I grew up in a small village on the English/Welsh border and wrote my first story when I was six years old about a rabbit called “Rabbit” and when I was eleven, I wrote my first “novel” about seven cursed diamonds and the people who owned them. I studied French and Classics at University and spent a year in Paris as part of my course. </p>
